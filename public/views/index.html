	      	<p>
	      	Dear Gov Corbett,
	      	</p>
	      	<p>Please consider this your open invitation to visit our neighborhood school, Andrew Jackson.  You are invited to meet with parents, children, and staff to learn more about the impact that the Philadelphia public school funding crisis is having on actual students and neighborhoods, who are eager to learn and grow, yet handicapped by a lack of basic supplies and staff.</p>
			<p>“The foundation of every state is the education of its youth” Diogenes Laertius</p>
			<p>“Next in importance to freedom and justice is popular education, without which neither freedom nor justice can be permanently maintained” James A. Garfield July, 12 1880</p>
			<p>Jackson is an example of an inner city Philadelphia school that works, and is improving every year.  To attend you simply need to walk to the door and enroll; no application, no tests, no political favors to win a “lottery” and no huge tuition bill.    It is a simple public school with caring teachers, a strong principal and active parents and community partners fighting to make a great school even better.  We are firm believers in public education and with the help of many groups; it is possible to educate all children and create a community anchor.</p>

			<p>“Doomsday is here”</p>
			<p>
				We have seen the mounting statistics, the arguments, and the threats at a system level:
				<ul>
					<li>A $2.3 Billion budget, but $304 million shortfall</li>
					<li>$50 million emergency City donation to open the schools on time at a “functional” level</li>
					<li>24 schools closed</li>
					<li>Rotating Counselors for schools less than 600 kids</li>
					<li>Very few assistant principals</li>
					<li>$45 million Federal funds being withheld by the state until union concessions are reached</li>
					<li>$103 million in PFT concessions as the goal</li>
					<li>More than 3800 district teachers, staff and administrators fired</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				On a school level the budget implications have left Jackson:
				<ul>
					<li>With 90+ additional students over last year and 4 less teachers </li>
					<li>1 K teacher laid off and 1 force transferred</li>
					<li>Total of 3 forced transferred teachers</li>
					<li>1 transferred teacher, Mr. Malara, was loved by students and instrumental in grant writing campaigns for a rooftop garden with outside groups and resources, and leaves $15,000 in grant funding in jeopardy</li>
					<li>101 Kindergarten students enrolled, and only 1 returning teacher (2 others are being forced into K positions from upper grades, leaving those crowded; and learning new curriculums due to transfers and layoffs</li>
					<li>35+ kids in the K classes until leveling in October</li>
					<li>Overcrowded rooms in K-4th grades by large margins</li>
					<li>No counselor</li>
					<li>4 lost support staff</li>
					<li>No money for supplies</li>
					<li>Lack of desks for students, some are hopefully going to be brought in from closed schools in time for start of school</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			It is very difficult to digest and understand how these very concrete losses will forever affect the lives of the students within the school.  How can any 5 year old child thrive in a room with 35+ students, no aid, no copy paper, and maybe not even a desk?
			</p>
			<p>"What’s working"</p>
			<p>Governor Corbett, we are not unsympathetic to your situation. We know your schedule is busy, but the parents and community of Jackson need your help.  We'd also love to tell you everything that's working, and help other schools be equally as successful!  There are so many great things happening in a single school it is hard to encompass everything, but we would love to show you the next time you are in Philadelphia.</p>

				We are proud that our wonderful school is led by an amazing principal, Lisa Kaplan, who welcomes all community partnerships!  It is these partnerships, the dedicated staff, families and students working together which are helping the school to thrive.  The PSCA is working to grow the neighborhood support, and to keep people informed and involved in the school, many other partnerships are thriving to accelerate the growth of Jackson.
			</p>
			<p>
				Individual and corporate donations, grants, and partnership support have brought $150,000 in funds and activities into the school.  Recently a 15 year old girl in Radnor collected 410 backpacks full of supplies.  The PSCA is sponsoring a supply drive in the fall and in January to alleviate some of the budget cut backs and make sure all students have the basic physical tools to start the school year.  It is a true grass-roots effort by parents and community to support and encourage the growth of a learning community within the school.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rock band HOME didn’t exist 4 years ago, and now is touring the east coast and playing at venues such as the Kimmel Center and The Wilma Theater.  Primarily due to the drive of the teacher, Mr. A, the program has self-funded $30,000 worth of equipment to build a thriving program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please come to Jackson, and Passyunk Square, and listen to real parents and our perspectives on education funding, the importance of good teachers and how to drive increased community engagement.  It isn’t about union negotiations, education reform, and politics; but real live students who are just trying to learn.
			</p>
			<p>
				Come work with us to understand the real impacts of political decisions at the state and local level on individual students, and their as they try to begin the life-long pursuit of knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>Your visit</p>
			<p>
				Mr. Corbett, we invite you to tour Passyunk Square and see for your-self how the rich heritage of the past is being interwoven with new groups, ideas, and families.  The students at Jackson represent 28 national heritages and have 15 different languages spoken at home.  It is this diversity that continues to encourage rapid growth and investment in the neighborhood, but a great school is an essential piece for the growth to continue.
			</p>
			<p>Principal Kaplan leads the Jackson Jaguars:<br>
				"At Jackson, we emphasize the development of character as an integral part of our instructional program. We believe that intelligence along with outstanding character equals great success. Our students are motivated to learn in a risk-free environment.  Students are encouraged to set academic goals, organize, and take ownership of their education in a culture that demonstrates school pride and respect for self and others. My door is always open and I look forward to building a relationship with you and your student."
				<br>

  				- Principal L. Kaplan
  			</p>
  			<p>
				We are just one of the many groups rallying around our local public school to preserve the idea of a free and equitable education for all students.  Please come and see all the great things, meet some of the 494 students who are affected on a daily basis when funds are withheld from their education.  See how despite the doomsday situation these kids manage a 95% attendance rate for the school as a whole, and how they are truly walking through the doors every day willing and eager to learn!
			</p>
			<p>
				Please help us reinforce that they haven’t been forgotten, and that the politics of adults is not enough reason to throw away our hopes in their futures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for your consideration,<br>
				The Passyunk Square Civic Association Education Committee
